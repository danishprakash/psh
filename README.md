# psh
A simple shell implementation in Python with piping and a reference material for this [blogpost](https://danishprakash.github.io/2018/09/09/shell-in-python.html). Since this acts as a reference material, the feature set is minimal. It supports basic shell commands along with piping of commands. If you have any suggestions or if you've found some errors in this, kindly open an issue.

Note: This is not meant to be a replacement for your daily driver. Though, technically you *can* use it if you want but I'd suggest not to.
